# Taskr

A small task runner to simplify running tasks for the project.

The idea is to create a "1 stop shop" for all your commands and the dependencies have.

Eventually I want to add `stdout` hooks so it can also catch errors and log them to a log file.


# Contributing

If you would like to contribute, feel free to open a PR with whatever you think might be worth it. 
I do recommend creating an issue and linking the PR to that issue so I can easily keep the administration organised.
